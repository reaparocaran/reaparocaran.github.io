      <h2>Dance</h2>
       <br><p>
		I have been an Indian classical and fusion dancer since the age of three. I have done many stage performances and competitions throughout the years. It was a great way for me to connect with my Indian roots and quickly became a favorite hobby of mine. To this day I continue to dance at community events or through school. <br/><br/> I learned traditional style dance called Andhra Natyam and Bollywood fusion from family and family friends. I got to perform on many stages and even teach younger kids dances. Once I got to college, I joined a co-ed Bollywood fusion competitive dance team. We got to travel around the country and compete against other college teams. It has always been a passion of mine - it taught me a lot of discipline and the reward behind hard work. <br><br>

Travel:

I have been lucky enough to be able to travel with family and friends from a young age. I value the different cultures and perspectives you can gain from visiting other countries. Most recently, I went to Paris and Rome with my family in August. I have visited Dubai and India many times and am always willing to go back to see family.    -->
