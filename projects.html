       <h3>SI 206 Final Project </h3>
		<p>This group project had me work with Spotify APIs. We worked on taking a username's playlists, randomly choosing songs and tracking the lyrics of the songs. From there we were able to identify the most common words and see what kinda of moods users enjoyed listening too. We were careful about removing confunctions and meaningless words which helped develop our data manipulation skills.

    <h3>ENTR 390 App Development</h3>
    <p>I was able to learn about user experience research methods and create an app prototype. I decided to create an app that tells you information about coffee shops. For example, if you wanted to study there you can see how many people are currently there, the ambiance, lighting, etc. I was able to learn and apply UX components such as wireframing, personas, usability, and more.<br/><br/>

    <h3>EECS 183 Final Project</h3>
    <p>In this group project, we took the Mario theme song and using python to extract the notes and sort the different pitches. From there we were told to input a sentence and tokenize the words so that they correspond to a pitch - the end result was a musical composition of the inputted sentense. We split the tasks up between three people - we used the Spotify APIs to get the music data and create tunes. <br/><br/>
