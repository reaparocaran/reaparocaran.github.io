      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
       <p>I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, MI. Both my parents are from India and immigrated here after getting married. I have one older brother who is working as system's analyst. I am a current junior at the University of Michigan studying Information Analysis. <br><br>

		I have always valued the creativity and application of data analytics. I currently am interested in the applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as overall ethics of technology advancement in relation to society. I am looking for an internship opportunity for the summer of 2020. I want to make an impact in the workplace and be surrounded by a team that values productivity and empathy.<br><br>

		I also prioritize being an effective and dependable leader. In all activities I get involved with, whether it be through school or the community, I feel the most useful when I am involved with the intiatives. I am currently on the leadership committee for Ann Arbor Data Dive, UMSI Service Week, and an undergraduate representative on the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion UMSI group. In any future setting, I plan to place great importance on this ability in order to develop my skills and be effective for others.
